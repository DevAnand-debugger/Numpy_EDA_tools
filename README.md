# 1️⃣ AIM

To study the NumPy library and understand its importance in numerical computation and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

---

# 2️⃣ OBJECTIVES

- To understand the importance of NumPy in Python.
- To learn how to create and manipulate arrays.
- To study dimensions and shapes of arrays.
- To perform mathematical and statistical operations.
- To understand NumPy as the foundation of Pandas and other data science tools.

# 3️⃣ INTRODUCTION TO NUMPY

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful Python library used for numerical and scientific computing.

It provides:

- High-performance multidimensional arrays
- Mathematical functions
- Statistical operations
- Linear algebra operations
- Random number generation

NumPy is implemented in C, which makes it significantly faster than normal Python lists for numerical operations.

It is considered the backbone of the Python data science ecosystem and serves as the foundation for:

- Pandas
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow

---

# 4️⃣ WHY NUMPY?

NumPy is widely used because:

- It performs mathematical operations efficiently.
- It supports multi-dimensional arrays.
- It enables vectorized computation without explicit loops.
- It consumes less memory compared to Python lists.
- It provides built-in statistical and linear algebra functions.

In Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), NumPy helps in:

- Statistical calculations
- Data transformation
- Numerical modeling
- Feature scaling
- Matrix computations

---

# 5️⃣ NUMPY ARRAY

A NumPy array is a grid of values of the same data type.

Arrays can be:

- One-dimensional (1D)
- Two-dimensional (2D)
- Multi-dimensional (3D and above)

Unlike Python lists, NumPy arrays are homogeneous, meaning all elements must be of the same data type.

---

# 6️⃣ DIMENSIONS AND SHAPE

## Dimension

Dimension refers to the number of axes in an array.

- A 1D array has one axis.
- A 2D array has two axes (rows and columns).
- A 3D array has three axes.

## Shape

Shape refers to the structure of the array in terms of rows and columns.

Examples:

- A 1D array with 4 elements has shape `(4,)`
- A 2D array with 2 rows and 3 columns has shape `(2, 3)`

Understanding dimensions and shape is important in:

- Matrix operations
- Data reshaping
- Machine learning algorithms

---

# 7️⃣ DATA TYPES IN NUMPY

Each NumPy array has a fixed data type.

Common data types include:

- int32
- int64
- float32
- float64

Because NumPy arrays are homogeneous, they are more memory efficient than Python lists.

---

# 8️⃣ ARRAY CREATION FUNCTIONS

NumPy provides built-in functions to create arrays such as:

- `np.zeros()` → Creates array filled with 0
- `np.ones()` → Creates array filled with 1
- `np.eye()` → Creates identity matrix

These functions are widely used in mathematical modeling and matrix operations.

---

# 9️⃣ SEQUENCE GENERATION FUNCTIONS

NumPy provides methods to generate numerical sequences:

- `np.arange()` → Generates values within a given range
- `np.linspace()` → Generates evenly spaced numbers between two limits

These functions are commonly used in:

- Graph plotting
- Numerical simulations
- Data sampling

---

# 🔟 VECTOR OPERATIONS

One of the most powerful features of NumPy is vectorization.

Vectorized operations allow element-wise computation without writing explicit loops.

Advantages:

- Faster execution
- Cleaner syntax
- Efficient memory usage

Example operations:

- Addition
- Multiplication
- Scalar operations

---

# 1️⃣1️⃣ STATISTICAL FUNCTIONS

NumPy provides built-in statistical functions such as:

- Mean (`np.mean()`)
- Median (`np.median()`)
- Maximum (`np.max()`)
- Minimum (`np.min()`)
- Sum (`np.sum()`)

These functions are essential in:

- Data analysis
- EDA reports
- Data preprocessing
- Statistical summaries

---

# 1️⃣2️⃣ NUMPY IN EDA

In Exploratory Data Analysis, NumPy is used for:

- Computing descriptive statistics
- Handling numerical datasets
- Data transformation
- Normalization
- Preparing features for machine learning models

NumPy works together with Pandas for structured data analysis and is essential for data science workflows.

---

# 1️⃣3️⃣ ADVANTAGES OF NUMPY
