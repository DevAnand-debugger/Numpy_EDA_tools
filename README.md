# 5️⃣ NUMPY ARRAY

## Definition

A NumPy array is a grid of values, all of the same type, indexed by a tuple of non-negative integers.

### Example:

1D Array:
```python
a = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40])

2D Array:

b = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])

# 3️⃣ INTRODUCTION TO NUMPY

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful Python library used for numerical and scientific computing.

It provides high-performance multidimensional arrays and a large collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.

NumPy is implemented in C, which makes it significantly faster than normal Python lists for numerical operations.

It is considered the backbone of the Python data science ecosystem and serves as the foundation for libraries such as Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

---

# 4️⃣ WHY NUMPY?

NumPy is widely used because:

- It performs mathematical operations efficiently.
- It supports multi-dimensional arrays.
- It enables vectorized computation without explicit loops.
- It consumes less memory compared to Python lists.
- It provides built-in statistical and linear algebra functions.

In Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), NumPy helps in:

- Statistical calculations
- Data transformation
- Numerical modeling
- Feature scaling
- Matrix computations

# 5️⃣ NUMPY ARRAY

A NumPy array is a grid of values of the same data type.

Arrays can be:

- One-dimensional (1D)
- Two-dimensional (2D)
- Multi-dimensional (3D and above)

Unlike Python lists, NumPy arrays are homogeneous, meaning all elements must be of the same data type.

---

# 6️⃣ DIMENSIONS AND SHAPE

Dimension refers to the number of axes in an array.

- A 1D array has one axis.
- A 2D array has two axes (rows and columns).
- A 3D array has three axes.

Shape refers to the structure of the array in terms of rows and columns.

For example:
- A 1D array with 4 elements has shape (4,)
- A 2D array with 2 rows and 3 columns has shape (2, 3)

Understanding dimensions and shape is important in matrix operations, reshaping data, and machine learning algorithms.

---

# 7️⃣ DATA TYPES IN NUMPY

Each NumPy array has a fixed data type.

Common data types include:

- int32
- int64
- float32
- float64

Because NumPy arrays are homogeneous, they are more memory efficient than Python lists.

---

# 8️⃣ ARRAY CREATION FUNCTIONS

NumPy provides built-in functions to create arrays such as:

- Zeros array (all elements are 0)
- Ones array (all elements are 1)
- Identity matrix (diagonal elements are 1)

These functions are widely used in mathematical modeling and matrix operations.

---

# 9️⃣ SEQUENCE GENERATION FUNCTIONS

NumPy provides methods to generate numerical sequences such as:

- Generating numbers within a specified range
- Generating evenly spaced numbers between two limits

These are commonly used in plotting graphs and numerical simulations.

---

# 🔟 VECTOR OPERATIONS

One of the most powerful features of NumPy is vectorization.

Vectorized operations allow element-wise computation without writing explicit loops.

This results in:

- Faster execution
- Cleaner syntax
- Efficient memory usage

---

# 1️⃣1️⃣ STATISTICAL FUNCTIONS

NumPy provides built-in statistical functions such as:

- Mean (average)
- Median
- Maximum value
- Minimum value
- Sum of elements

These functions are essential in:

- Data analysis
- EDA reports
- Data preprocessing
- Statistical summaries

---

# 1️⃣2️⃣ NUMPY IN EDA
